    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or 
        hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining 
        ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. 
        Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients
         in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.

    <ol> 
       <li>Combine potatoes, onion, turkey, ham, celery, 
           carrots, asparagus, peas, and butternut squash 
           in a large pot. Pour chicken broth and water over 
           mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium 
           and simmer soup until potatoes and squash are 
           tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir Italian seasoning,
            white pepper, salt, and bay leaves into soup and
             continue to simmer.</li>
